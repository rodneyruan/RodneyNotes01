NumPy is a Python library.   
NumPy is used for working with arrays.   
NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".
```
### Why do we need Numpy
```
50x faster than traditional Python lists
Dat is stored at continuous place in memory
```

### Create an array
```
import numpy as np

a = np.array(42)
b = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])

print(a.ndim)
print(b.ndim)
print(c.ndim)
print(d.ndim)
```
