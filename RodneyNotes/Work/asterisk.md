### hotplug.d
/etc/hotplug.d/iface/80-asterisk   
In OpenWrt or similar systems, /etc/hotplug.d/iface/ is a directory where scripts are placed to be executed when network interface events occur, such as when a network interface is brought up or taken down. These scripts are automatically triggered by the system's "hotplug" mechanism in response to these events.
