Angel User Announcement

First of all, we would like to sincerely thank the community users for their support and trust. 
It is because of your encouragement and support that we can continuously improve and perfect Foggie. 


Here, we would like to especially thank the first 3000 users, 
it is your support that provided us with valuable experience and feedback. 
In order to express our gratitude to the first batch of users, we decided to define these 3000 users as "angel users". 
As long as your Foggie is in renewal activation status, you can enjoy the privilege of "Angel User". The following is the specific content of the "angel user" privilege:

1. We hope that each "angel user" will complete the payment as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary losses after the trial period ends. 
If the trial period has expired and the payment has not been completed, we will take back all DMC rewards, the server resources you occupy, and all related rights and interests. All recovered DMC will be used for community activities and services, and privileges will be granted to users who actively participate in community building.

2. As an "angel user", you will have the priority to experience ecological projects and products, as well as more mysterious surprises. 
We will announce ecological cooperation and release ecological products from time to time, and angel users will experience various new functions and products at the first time. 
We hope that these ecological projects and products can bring you a better experience and more benefits.

In addition, you are not only our user, but also our partner. 
The future of Web3 is full of opportunities and challenges. 
We believe that only by cooperating with users can we make Web3 more open and free, 
and allow more people to benefit from this new Internet era. 
Therefore, we encourage you to keep in touch with us and share your thoughts and suggestions. 
We will continue to listen to your voice, explore and discover the future of Web3 with you, and create a better Web3 world together! 
Finally, we thank you again for your support and trust. 
We will continue to work hard to continuously improve and perfect Foggie to make it an even better product.
