Writing for Academic Discussion (Writing Question Two)
Here’s a really straightforward template that is easy to use.

While some people might think [opposite of my opinion], I really believe that [my opinion]
First of all, [elaborate on the opinion].
Actually, I have some experience with this.
[a quick personal example]
 

Here’s a template that focuses on giving an entirely new answer and ignoring the other student responses.  This is my favorite template.

While I appreciate the points mentioned by both STUDENT 1 and STUDENT 2, I think that…
[elaborate on your idea for a few sentences]
Remember that [elaborate on your point], so [elaborate on your point].
Some people may feel that [mention a potential challenge], but [respond to this challenge].
 

Here’s a template that focuses on expanding on and challenging the points mentioned by the other students.  I don’t like this template as much, but some people prefer it.

This is a challenging topic, but I think that [respond directly to the question].
I strongly agree with [student]’s idea that [mention one point made by the student]. 
I’d add that [expand on the point with your own idea].
While [other student] raised the relevant point that [mention one point made by the other student], he/she didn’t mention that [challenge that point].
For example [elaborate on your challenge with your own ideas].
