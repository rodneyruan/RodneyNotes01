I live in a house on a quiet street.
It’s not far from  the town centre and it’s a twenty-minute walk to the train station. 
There is a bus stop near the house.
The house has got a living room with a large sofa and a television.
There’s also a large kitchen  with a table and three chairs.
In the kitchen,  there is a washing machine, a dishwasher and a fridge-freezer. 
outside, there’s a small garden behind the house.
Upstairs,there are two bedrooms. 
The main bedroom is big. It has got a double bed, a desk and a wardrobe. The guest bedroom only has a single bed. 
There’s one bathroom,  but it doesn’t have a bath. It just has a shower.


Last night, I was walking (walk) home when I saw (see) a car running very fast towards a red light.
I looked (look) at the driver and I could see that he was talking (talk) on his phone.
He didn’t stop (not stop) at the traffic light, and another car crashed (crash) into him and killed (kill) him. 
When the police arrived they asked me what had happened (happen) 
and I told (tell) them that the driver hadn’t seen (not see) the traffic light because he was on his phone.


Many years ago, I 1 
 (travel) along Central America with a friend. We 2 
 (travel) across Honduras for a couple of days when we 3 
 (arrive) at the border with Nicaragua. When we 4 
 (show) our passports to the border officers, they 5 
 (tell) us that in order to cross the border we had to pay some money; it wasn’t much, maybe a couple of dollars.

"What?" I said. I couldn't believe it. We didn’t have any money, because we 6 
 (see) any banks in the few villages we 7 
 (visit) along the way. We had a credit card, but it was Sunday and the banks were closed, so we couldn’t take out any money in the nearby villages. We 8 
 (beg) the officers to let us cross, but they just wanted to get their four dollars and they didn't care if we had to stay there the whole weekend.

We 9 
 (stand) there, next to the officers, when an old man dressed in very old and dirty clothes 10 
 (say), “I’ll pay the taxes for these two young men.” We were amazed. That man looked very poor, the kind of person for whom 4 dollars could be a big deal. “We don’t know how to thank you,” I said. And he replied, “A la mano que da, nunca le falta de nada”, which means something like 'A giving hand never goes empty'.

 Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the mountains, there was a young boy named Max who had a deep passion for basketball. Max had been playing basketball since he was just four years old and had a natural talent for the game.

Max would spend every spare moment practicing his moves and perfecting his shots, dreaming of one day becoming a professional basketball player. His dedication to the sport was unwavering, and he would often stay up late watching basketball games and studying the techniques of his favorite players.

As Max grew older, his skills on the court continued to improve, and he became a star player on his high school basketball team. His talent did not go unnoticed, and he was soon scouted by a college basketball coach who offered him a full scholarship to play for their team.

Max's dream of playing basketball at the college level had become a reality, and he was determined to make the most of this opportunity. He worked tirelessly, honing his skills and leading his team to victory after victory.

As Max's college career came to an end, he was scouted by a professional basketball team and was offered a spot on their roster. Max could hardly believe it - his childhood dream of becoming a professional basketball player was finally coming true.

Max's first season in the pros was a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs, but he never gave up. He pushed through every setback, every injury, and every defeat, determined to prove himself as a top basketball player.

And then, in the championship game of Max's second season, with just seconds left on the clock and his team down by two points, Max seized the opportunity of a lifetime. He dribbled the ball past the opposing team's defenders, faked a shot, and then made a perfect pass to his teammate who sunk the game-winning shot.

Max's team won the championship, and Max was hailed as a hero. His hard work, determination, and passion for basketball had led him to the top of the game, and he knew that he had achieved his childhood dream.

From that day forward, Max continued to play basketball with the same passion and dedication that had carried him to the top. And though he faced many challenges and obstacles along the way, he knew that with hard work and perseverance, anything was possible.

College tuition has been rising steadily, putting financial pressure on many families. One proposal is that government should cover tuition costs so that anyone can attend college for free. What do you think? Should government pay for college and make higher education free? Please explain your viewpoint.


Claire: 

I believe college should be free for all students. This would promote fairness and access to education, giving underprivileged students more opportunities. Everyone deserves a chance to pursue higher education, regardless of their financial situation. Free tuition would open doors for many capable students who currently can't afford the high costs of attending college.


Paul:

I don't think college should be free for all. That could attract many students who aren't genuinely interested in learning, overcrowding classes. It's better to keep some cost so students are motivated and classes aren't too large, which hurts the quality of education.

Should Government Pay for College and Make Higher Education Free?
 
In today's society, the issue of whether the government should cover college tuition costs and make higher education free is a highly debated topic. While some argue that free college would promote fairness and provide more opportunities for underprivileged students, others believe it could lead to overcrowding and a lack of motivation among students.
 
On one hand, making college free for all students, as Claire suggests, has several significant advantages. Firstly, it would greatly enhance access to education. Many talented students from low-income families are currently unable to afford college tuition, which limits their potential and restricts social mobility. By removing this financial barrier, the government would be giving these students a chance to pursue their dreams and contribute to society. Secondly, free college would promote fairness. Education is a fundamental right, and everyone should have an equal opportunity to obtain a higher education regardless of their financial situation. This would help to level the playing field and reduce inequality.
 
On the other hand, Paul's concerns are also valid. If college were completely free, it could attract students who are not genuinely interested in learning. This might lead to overcrowded classes and a decline in the quality of education. Additionally, without some financial investment from students, there may be a lack of motivation to study hard and make the most of the educational opportunities. Moreover, providing free college education would place a significant financial burden on the government. Taxpayers would have to bear the cost, which could lead to higher taxes or cuts in other important areas such as healthcare or infrastructure.
 
In conclusion, while the idea of free college is appealing for its potential to promote fairness and access to education, it also comes with certain challenges. A possible solution could be a hybrid approach. The government could provide partial tuition support or scholarships based on merit and financial need. This would ensure that those who truly deserve and are committed to higher education can receive financial assistance without completely eliminating the cost for students. Additionally, colleges could implement stricter admission criteria to ensure that only motivated students are admitted. By finding a balance between accessibility and quality, we can strive towards a more equitable and effective higher education system.
