### Two and and a tiger
```
Two men are walking through a forest.  Suddenly, they see a tiger in the distance, running towards them.
They turn and start running away.  But then one of them stops, takes some running shoes from his bag, and starts putting them on.
“What are you doing?” says the other man.  “Do you think you will run faster than the tiger with those?”
“I don’t have to run faster than the tiger,” he says.  “I just have to run faster than you.”

One night, Tim was walking home, and all of a sudden a robber jumped on him.
Tim and the robber began to fight.  They fought and fought, but finally the robber managed to pin him to the ground.
He searched Tim’s pockets, but only found 25 cents!  The robber was so surprised that he asked Tim, “Why did you fight so hard for just 25 cents?”
Tim said, “I thought you wanted to steal the $500 that I’ve got in my shoe!”
