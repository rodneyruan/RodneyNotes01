My favorite color of clothes is blue, i just find it To be a soothing and Versatile color That goes well with many styles and colors.
A lot of my clothes are a shade of blue.

I never wear clothes with really elaborate designs or loud , bright colours，I prefer to keep my wardrobe simple. because 
i don't want to draw too much attention to my clothing。
Also i never wear anything too formal. Like a suit or Tuxedo

I usually wear casual and comfortable clothing. Like t shirts, jeans. And sneakers.I like to be comfortable in my clothing, and feel relaxed in what i'm wearing.
During the week i tend to wear more formal or business casual clothes.
For example, button up shirts.
On the weekend i prefer to wear More comfortable and relaxed clothing.
Like Sweat pants And a hoodie.



The place where i'm able to relax and unwind the most is a small park near my home. The park is just down the road from my apartment.Not far from the main walking street.Which is busy at all hours of the day.
Fully covered by trees and vegetation. it is a Peaceful oasis In the midst of the city.
I find it to be the perfect place to escape the hustle. And bustle of the city.

The park is well maintained. There are plenty of benches and picnic tables where i can sit and enjoy the scenery。
Sometimes on the weekend afternoon i will bring some snacks. And drinks, and have a picnic with my friends.
Other times, i prefer to go alone and bring a book.
There is also someExercise equipment and a basketball Court.
I have never used the exercise equipment, and sometimes i play basketball with my neighbors.
It's pretty lively  in the park on a summer night.
At least once a week, there will be group exercise in the evening.And sometimes there are community events.
Whether i'm reading or taking a walk, or just simply enjoying the peaceful  atmosphere i  always Feel relaxed and refreshed when i leave.
